Build a Calculator 
The Calculator is a straightforward web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
offering basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) in a responsive,
user-friendly design. Clone the repo, open index.html to use it, and tweak styles.css 
or script.js to customize appearance or add features.
